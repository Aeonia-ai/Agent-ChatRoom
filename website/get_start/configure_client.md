After [install the client](install_client.md), you can configure the client by creating a configuration file. Below is an example of a configuration file for the client:

[!code-json[](../../configuration/chatroom-client.json)]

After creating the configuration and saving it to `chatroom-client.json`, you can start the client with the following command:

```bash
chatroom --config chatroom-client.json
```
